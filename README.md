# Mimi and Pepper

## Feeding

Mimi and Pepper are fed on a schedule, three times a day:

1. Morning feeding, between 10AM-12PM, wet meal
2. Afternoon feeding, between 4PM-6PM, dry meal
3. Night feeding, between 10PM-12AM, wet meal with medicine for Mimi

### Wet meals

Leftover wet food from previous feeding is stored covered or Ziploc-ed in the fridge. Sachets are stored in the glass on the door:

Pepper's canned Blue Mountain may be stored in the small glass snapware:
![Tupperware](./static/tupperware.jpeg)

Fresh containers of wet food are on the shelf in the living room:

![Full wet food containers](./static/wet-food-stored.jpeg)

Pepper eats 2/5 a sachet of Gravies, or half a can of Blue Mountain. See proportions below:

Mimi eats a scoop of Hill's K/D chicken pate, mixed with some Delectables bisque and a spoonful of water. Be sure to mix the 3 components well as Mimi doesn't like chunky textures. See proportions below:

Microwave each meal, covered with green silicone cover, for 12 seconds each. The green silicone cover is by the sink:

After microwaving, sprinkle each meal with 1/4 satchet of Fortiflora, or just enough to cover the entire meal:

Fortiflora is stored in the pantry:

Finally, add a dot of Churu on top of each meal:

Mimi and Pepper eat in different rooms with the door closed, as they like to steal each others' food. Mimi can't have high protein meals, and Pepper shouldn't have the K/D diet either for each of their health. Mimi eats in the kitchen, and Pepper eats in the bedroom:

![Mimi in kitchen](./static/mimi-eating.jpeg)
![Pepper in bedroom](./static/pepper-eating.jpeg)

Please close the bedroom door while Pepper is eating. Watch out for her tail!

Mimi may not finish all of his food. Leftovers for Mimi are stored, covered by the silicone cover, in the fridge, for addition to the next meal. If the next meal is dry, start with the leftover wet food (microwaved 12 seconds) and top up with dry food.

### Dry meals

Dry food is stored in the pantry. Both kitties eat 1/4 cup of dry food from their labeled containers for their midday feeding. Wet the food with a little bit of water so they stay hydrated.

### Mimi's medicine

Mimi takes 0.65mL of Telmisartan daily for his blood pressure. He has this before his nighttime meal. Location of the medicine:

![Medicine location](./static/mimi-medicine.jpeg)

Syringe is white and is located in the dish drying rack. You'll have the eyeball the 0.65 dose as the lines for it aren't there.
![Syringe](./static/mimi-syringe.jpeg)

Medicine should be placed in food bowl and topped with Churu. Don't microwave!
![Medicine proportions](./static/mimi-medicine-churu.jpeg)

If Mimi finishes eating the Churu but there's still some medicine, add a bit more Churu. You'll have to keep Pepper distracted with Churu during this process as she will try to have some medicine too.

## Litter box
Mimi and Pepper use the Litterbot, an automated litterbox. It detects (for the most part) when they've used the bot, and cycles automatically. The light will remain a solid blue while the bot is functional. At nighttime, the bot will enter "sleep mode" and a solid yellow LED will also light up.

When the bot is full, the blue LED will flash instead of being solid, and the bag under the bot will need to be replaced. This should happen about once a week so it's pretty low-maintenance. [Here](https://youtu.be/e4PaCFL1js0?t=30) is a short video about how to empty the litterbot. Replacement plastic bags are on the shelf above the printer.

## Accidents

All accidents with vomit may be cleaned up with a combination of paper towels, wet wipes, and enzymatic pet cleaning spray if the stain is persistent. Wet wipes and spray are both in the bathroom. The teal towels can also be used if necessary.

![Wet wipes](./static/wipes.jpeg)
![Spray](./static/spray.jpeg)

Mimi is an anxious cat and may pee outside the litterbox. Hopefully this doesn't happen as he did this a lot when he had a UTI. When this happens, blot up the pee with paper towels, then spray enzymatic cleaner and leave in according to the directions on the bottle. Blot up with paper towels or teal towels.

Warning: Mimi did pee on the bed a few times while he had a UTI. All the sheets, mattress covers, pillows (except the memory foam ones), and pillowcases are machine-washable. Block access to the head of the bed with pillows as the mattress covers don't protect the sides of the mattress.

# Houseplants

There are four categories of plants: succulents, plants in semi-hydro (with inorganic substrates of pon or leca and visible water reservoirs), plants in soil, and crops in the grow tent.

Note: the grow lights over the plant rack near the balcony door are HOT. Please be careful!

Note 2: If you run out of distilled water, feel free to use filtered tap water, but add a drop of tap water conditioner:

![Tap water conditioner](./static/tap-water-conditioner.jpeg)

## Succulents

Succulents both inside and outside can be left alone for the two weeks, they will be fine.

## Semi-hydro

Plants in semi-hydro are comprised of the entire bottom shelf of the plant cabinet, three plants on the middle shelf that are in leca, the two hanging plants by the balcony door, and the Monstera aurea in the bedroom.

Please top up plants in semi-hydro with Hydroguard when the water line falls below the substrate line (this should take around a week but varies). You may need to make a fresh batch of Hydroguard. You can use distilled water stored in bottles or from the A/C for this. The Hydroguard concentrate is stored on the bookshelf. The amount of Hydroguard per bottle is labeled on the bottle itself:

![Hydroguard](./static/hydroguard.jpeg)
![Hydroguard location](./static/hydroguard-location.jpeg)
![Hydroguard and BTI](./static/hydroguard-BTI.jpeg)

## Plants in soil

Plants in soil are comprised of the outdoor plants (excluding succulents), the Monstera in the bedroom, the non-hanging plants on the rack by the balcony door, and the rest of the plants in the cabinet. The plants in the cabinet are a bit crowded so you can take them out when watering, and water them in the tub and let them drain before returning them.

I've been watering all the plants in soil about once a week, and they've been fine. When watering using the watering can, combine foliage pro in the gallon jug with distilled water, and add a drop of anti fungus-gnat liquid.

## Grow tent

The basil and bush beans are the only crops that require watering daily. The radishes and mint are on the decline but you can give the mint some water if you remember. Split a watering can of water between the basil & beans. Please feel free to use all the basil you want as it's a bit overgrown!

If you see any flowers on the basil, trim them off. Also harvest any bush beans you see if they're ripe.

# Other apartment things

## A/C

The air conditioner produces a lot of water while active, especially in medium / high settings. Please don't leave it unattended when running (such as overnight). You can collect it for use in watering plants, and dump any excess. You can use the distilled gallon water jugs by the grow tent.

## Location of supplies

- Paper towels: in Michael's office in the closet
- Toilet paper: on the shelf next to the washer and dryer
- Drying rack for hang-dry clothes: on the balcony
